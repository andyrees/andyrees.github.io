Hi I&amp;rsquo;m Andy and welcome to my blog.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in Devon in the UK with my wife Rebecca and enjoy working out, photography, programming and technology in general. I like programming but I love taking mundane tasks and simplifying them with code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started programming with BASIC in the 70s on a BBC Micro, Assembly code at University, then C and C++ later, Bash, Java &amp;amp; C#. At University I studied Electronic Engineering BENG (HONS), but came away with skills in business, advanced engineering mathematics, Digital &amp;amp; analogue electronics, programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;from-python-to-go:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;From Python to Go&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the writer of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://xkcd.com/353/&#34;&gt;XKCD&lt;/a&gt; blog, Python allowed me to enjoy programming again; once you get used to the white space or get a decent ide like Pycharm. But my recent obsession is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.golang.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Golang&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python might be nice to write, but it can be complex to deploy. However, Go has inferred runtime static typing, compiles to an executable with no runtime dependencies and is garbage collected and is as much a pleasure to code as python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go is increasingly the answer for both small and large projects, in my day to day activities. My recent adventures with broadcast regulations and perceived loudness, ended with quite a nice example of Go&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness resulting in a really useful &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/andyrees/loudfixer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;utility&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;give-it-a-r-e-s-t:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;Give it a R.E.S.T.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote the Ooyala client API in GO, which was fun and enabled me to run a lot of imports and updates from an old system very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most fun I have had so far is to write a REST based transcode engine in go that leverages FFMPEG and inotify on Ubuntu. The result is a prioitisable, opensource transcode engine with a web front end in angularjs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go makes this so easy and with the REST backend, I could easily create a massive transcode nextwork and control it all via a master REST controller.&lt;/p&gt;
